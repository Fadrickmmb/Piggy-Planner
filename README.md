# Piggy-Planner

This app is in Portuguese, since I created it while I was still in Brazil.

This is an app intended to help people achieve their financial goals, and show them 3 different ways to save money for that specific goal.
First, the user enters their name and their goal. It could be a new car, a new Tv or even a trip to Paris.
Then, the user enters how much that goal costs.
Piggy will show 3 ways the user can save money to achieve that goal:
1) Daily (How much the user should save a day for as long as he chose the goal to be);
2) Monthly (How much the user should save a month for as long as he chose the goal to be);
3) Incrementing Savings (30 "deposits" the user should make to their savings. Each deposit is bigger than the previous);
